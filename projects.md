I've been coding for around 4 years. In that time, I've created some projects for myself and other people using a range of programming languages and tools. Here is a collection of my projects **in order of notability**:

### [wavey](https://github.com/isgood-dev/wavey) (2021 - present)

By far one of my biggest projects, wavey is a music player that has many built in features. I started this project back in 2021 and has been an ongoing effort since then.

Initially developed using Python with Tkinter, I created this to better understand UI development. The player only featured simple functionality and looked fairly ugly (Tkinter is severely outdated). Having started learning Rust, I made the decision of [rewriting](https://github.com/isgood-dev/wavey/pull/19) it using the Iced-rs framework. Iced-rs allowed me to make a pretty UI at relative ease, and is a decision I have no regrets making.

### [Car Park Management System](https://github.com/acatiadroid/CarParkManagementSystem) (2023 - 2024)

As a part of my university work, I was tasked with creating a car park management system that would handle incoming/outgoing vehicles in a car park in Java. The system would also handle reading from and writing to a CSV file, which I had to write the parser for. The requirements of the system are in the [README](https://github.com/acatiadroid/CarParkManagementSystem?tab=readme-ov-file#project-requirements).

### [PAT Report Generator](https://github.com/acatiadroid/PAT-Report) (2024 - present)

I created this project in an effort to help a family member with their business and to better understand the C++ language. The purpose of this was to create PAT (Portable Appliance Testing) reports to show the results of the PAT test in a nice, readable format. This project uses the wxWidgets UI library to create the application. It uses XML files to store the results of the report which I had to parse.

### API wrappers
I created some wrappers to communicate with certain API's. Both written in Python and both offer asynchronous support or synchronous support interchangeably. **Here's a list:**

#### [PyBloxlink](https://github.com/acatiadroid/pybloxlink) (2024 - present)

Having noticed that there was no wrapper for the Bloxlink API, I took the initiative to create one with async support to help other developers easily interact with the Bloxlink API.

#### [wantstoparty](https://github.com/acatiadroid/wantstoparty) (2021 - 2022)
![](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=py)

I created this for the same reasons as [PyBloxlink](#pybloxlink-2024---present).

### And that's all.
This list is not exhaustive, and I'll continue adding to it for the future.
