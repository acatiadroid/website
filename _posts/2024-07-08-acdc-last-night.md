Last night I saw AC/DC in Wembley Stadium in London. The experience was good, but not the best. I do wish there was more crowd engagement from the band. Also, to get anywhere near the band you'd have to pay extra to get into a different area of the stage which I was not impressed with.

Here is all the pictures on a Google Photos album:

Having spoken to some people who attended, they weren't overly impressed with the performance. Some of the reasons included:
* Lack of crowd interaction
* Bad acoustics of Wembley stadium
* Needing to pay extra to get anywhere near the stage
* 20 minute long guitar solo

That said, it was overall a good day.
